## Does the channel need to be publicly accessible to be included in the playlists?
Yes, we only need the links to be publicly accessible like FTA packages, online services or official websites. We recommend tagging [Geo-blocked] if it is only accessible in a certain country.

## Can I add a FTA channel that broadcasts PPV events or pay programming?
Perhaps. Consider that owners can ban the broadcast of PPV events, and even DCMA takedowns. Check the blocklist from the repository database for more info about specific events.

## Why is recommended the "playlist.m3u" or "index.m3u" at the end of the url?
These files use adaptive resolution, also the streams are permanent, that avoids dependence on tokens or temporal files.

## Why don't we accept XStreamCode in streams?
XStreamCode contains code that could be malicious to users.

## Is possible to add streams from Youtube, Dailymotion or Twitch?
Yes. Due to technical limitations is necessary add a Streamlink server link to view the content. 

## Is it possible to add audio-only streams, like FM radio?
No. Exceptions are the visual radios, in which a video and audio are shown at the same time.

## Why are there some ids with call sign (WATB-TV.us) and others with alphanumeric id (Mychannel.us)?
It's to differentiate the origin of the broadcast from the content. Call signs usually come from physical stations in the country of origin and their programming is subject to change.

## There are source for verify call sign and coverage area for some TV stations?
There are websites to consult the location and characteristics of the station. For example, [FCCData](https://fccdata.org/) for US, Canada, Mexico UK, Austrailia and Japan.

## Why some stream have empty id?
It is because the stream does not have enough information available of its origin. If you know, let us know its official name, the language it broadcasts and the country where it originates.

A "daily update" is maintenance to check the status of the playlist operation, as well as to hide from the playlist if the stream has access problems.

No, to avoid possible abuse of the service.
