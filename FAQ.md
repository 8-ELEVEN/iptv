## Does the channel need to be FTA to be included in the playlists?
No, as some come from satellite services or freely accessible websites. We recommend tagging [Geo-blocked] if it is only accessible in a certain country.

## Can I add a FTA channel that broadcasts PPV events or pay programming?
Perhaps. Consider that owners can ban the broadcast of PPV events, and even DCMA takedowns. Check if this channel is in the blocklist from the repository database.

## Why is recommended the "playlist.m3u" or "index.m3u" at the end of the url?
These files use adaptive resolution, which avoids dependence on tokens or temporal files.

## Why don't we accept XStreamCode in streams?
XStreamCode contains code that could be malicious to users.

## Is possible to add streams from Youtube, Dailymotion or Twitch?
Yes. 

(the answer is yes, when it is not geolocalized and the initial url is fullspeed.tv)

## Is it possible to add audio-only streams, like FM radio?
(no)
## Why are there some ids with call sign (WATB-TV.us) and others with alphanumeric id (Mychannel.us)?
(perhaps due of how the broadcasting behave in DTTV, analog TV or web stream)
## There are source for verify call sign and coverage area for some TV stations?
FCCData for US, Canada, Mexico UK, Austrailia and Japan.
## Why some stream have empty id?
(because their entries are not registered in the database)
## What is a "daily update" and what is the benefit of this check?
(A "daily update" is a frequent revision that ensures which streams are working, as well as showing technical details in the API)
## Is it possible to view channels directly from the site?
(no, because this option generates confusion by offering the playlists only for public access with the entire list of channels accessible on other websites)
## What happens when a channel is labeled NSFW and does NSFW apply if there is adult programming?
## Do I have to pay to use this list?
(no)
## Are you planning to include a VOD of the programs broadcast on this playlist?
(no)
